* Kubernetes Architecture 

Nodes aka Minions 

A node is a machine, virtual or phyisic 
A cluster is a set of nodes grouped together. 

A cluset has a master node that mananges other nodes, it is called the master while other are workers

Kubernets componentes => when u install k8s, u actualy install the folwing components 

  - API server
  - Scheduler
  - Controller 
  - Container runtime  
  - kubelet 
  _ etcd 

API Server acts as the k8s front end; each command will hit directly the api server. 
etcd is a ditributed reliable key-value store used buy K8s to store all the information 
Scheduler is responsible for distributing loads across all the nodes 
Controller are the brain of the k8s
Container runtime is the underling software that is used to run container, it can be Docker, rkt or cri-o
Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. 

The master have a kube-apiserver, that is what makes it a master 


I  POD
   ____

A pod is the smollest object that u can create in k8s
a pod contains generaly one application. 
there are some use cases where we can run two applications in the same pode but they have to have the same lifetime 

: To create a pod with had hoc commande 
 => kubeclt run nginx --image <image_name>


Creating pod using yaml: 

apiVersion: v1 #this is determines the family of the object u want to create  
Kind: Pod # defines the type of the object
metadata:
  name : myapp-pod 
  labels: 
    app: myapp
    type : front-end

spec:
  containers : # list/array
    - name : ndinx-container
      image : nginx


Once the file is created, run the commande "kubeclt craete -f <name_of_the_file>"

Once the pod is created, u can run the command kubectl get pods to see ur pod running 
You can also us the command "kubectl describe pod <pod_name>"

____

1) How many pods exist on the system ? 
 > kubeclt get po   /this will get u all the nodes deployed in defaul namespace
2) Create a pod with the nginx image 
 > kubectl run nginx --image nginx 
3) how many pods are created now ? /they had added new po in the labs 
 > kubectl get po 
4) What is the image used to create new pods ? 
 > kubectl describe pod <name of one of the pods>
5) Which nodes are these pods placed on ? 
 > kubectl get po -o wide /this lists pods and more info which contains node
6) how many containers are part of the pod webapp ? 
 > kubectl get po /and then check the colmon READY to see number of expected pods
7) what images are used in the new webapp pod 
 > kubectl describe pod webapp /go check the images in spec section 
8) what is the state of the container agentx in the pod webapp ? 
 > kubectl describe po webapp /check state
9) why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error ? 
 >/A Docker image with this name doent not exist on Docker hub
10) what does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicates ? 
 > Running containers in pod/Total containers expected in Pod
11) Delete the webapp Pod 
 > kubectl delete po webapp
12) Create a new pod with the name redis and with the image redis123 (Use a pod-definition YAML file, and yes the image is wrong)
 > vim redis.yaml
 > kubectl create -f redis.yaml
 /this will create a pod but it's STATUS will be ImangePullBackOff
13) Now change the image on this pod to redis
 > kubectl edit po redis
 /this will open a the recap file in vi/vim wich have all the information about the po, once u edit the image and save, it will update the pod. note that this does not change the orginal file 

Note that there are 3 way to edit pod : 
  1 by editing the the definition file when it exists
  2 by extractind the definition file using this commande 
    >kubectl get pod <pod name> - yaml > pod-definition.yaml
  3 use the kubectl edit pod <pod-name>

II  KUBERNETES CONTROLLERS 
    ___________________

Controller are the brain behind kubernetes processes that monitors k8s objects and repond accordingly

II.1 Replication controller

what is the replication controller and why do we need it ? 
In the first part we created bare pod that was running one application, what happens if for some reason the pod dies ? well the application will no longer be accessible for the users 

The replication controller helps us run multiple instances of the application so multiple pod, but it can alse be used to run just one pod. If one pod dies, the controller will create a new to keep the desired number of the pods (application instances)

Another advantage of using replication controller, is Load Balancing & Scaling 

One thing to know there are two simular terms : 

Replication controller   |  Replica Set 
both have the same purpers but the are not the same 

Replication controller is the older version that is being replaced by Replica Set, it is now recommend to use replica set 

A replication controller definition file looks like this

apiVersion : v1 
kind : ReplicatoinController
metadata :
   labels: 
     app : myapp
     type : front-end
spec: 
  template : 
    /here u put every thing need to create a pod, except the apiVersion and the kind. So u will have something like 
    metadata:
       name: 
       labels: 
    spec: 
  replicas : 3 

After the file is created run > kubectl create -f <file name>
To see the created replication controllers created (in this case one) run 
> kubectl get replicationcontroller

a replica set definition file looks like this : 

apiVersion : apps/v1 (notice the difference) 
kind : ReplicaSet
metadata:
  labels: 
spec: 
  template : 
    /here u put every thing need to create a pod, except the apiVersion and the kind. So u will have something like
    metadata:
       name:
       labels:
    spec:
  replicas: number
  selector:
    matchLabels:
 
  /this is required while creatting a ReplicaSet, this help the RS to know wich pod is under it. This means that the replicaset can controlle pods that are created out of it self. Once a pod muches the selector, it is part of the replicat set. 
/Note that selector is available in replication controller but it is not required. 

after the file is created, run > kubectl create -f <file name> 
to seet the created replicaset run 
> kubeclt get replicaset 

Scale with replicaset : There are multiple ways to do that 
  1 Edit the number of need replicas in the definition file, and the run this command 
   > kubectl replace -f <file name>
  2 run the scale command in adhoc 
   > kubectl scale --replicas=<new number of replicas> -f <file name>
   You can also use this command like this 
   > kubectl scale --replicas=<new number of replicas> replicaset <replicaset name>
   
   However, this will not update the number of replicas in the definition file
  3 you can also scale based on the application load but that is an advenced topic, we will see that later 


LAB 2 REPLICASETS to access the lab go to : https://uklabs.kodekloud.com/topic/replicasets-2/

1) How many Pods exists on the system ? 
 > kubectl get po /this will show pods deployed in the default namespace 
2) How many ReplicaSets exists on the system 
 > kubectl get rs /this will show replicasets that are deployed in default namespace
3) How about now (We just made a few changes)
 > kubectl get rs 
4) How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set ? 
 > kubectl get rs /check the DESIRED colmun 
5) What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set ? 
 > kubectl describe rs new-replica-set /this will display all the info about the replicaset where u can see the image
6) How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set ?
 > kubectl get rs /check the READY colmun
7) Why do you think the PODs are not ready ? 
 / The image used does not exist on docker hub registry 
8) Delete any one ot the 4 PODs 
 > kubectl delete pod 
9) How many PODs exist now ? 
 > kubectl get po /we can see that the rs has recreated the pod 
10) Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one ? 
 /the ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs alwas run 
11) Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definion-1.yaml (there is an issue with the file, os try to fix it)
 > vim replicaset-definition-1.yaml 
 /edit the apiVersion wich is incorrect 
 > kubectl create -f replicatset-definition-1.yaml 
12) Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create replicaset using it 
 > vim replicaset-definition-2.yaml 
  /there was a miss macth between the labels 
 > kubectl create -f replicatset-defiinition-2.yaml
13) Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets
 > kubectl delete rs replicaset-1
 > kubectl delete rs replicaset-2
14) fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image 
 > kubectl edit rs new-replica-set 
 /and the delete all the pods to restard new ones 
15) Scalle the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs 
 > kubectl scale --replicas=5 rs new-replica-set 
16) new scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 pods 
 > kubectl scal -replicas=2 rs new-replica-set.

III DEPLOYMENT 
    ----------
The deploymetn provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlying instances seamlessly using rolling updates, undo changes and pause and resume changes required. So the deployments over wrappes the replicat set adding the possibility to controlle the updates and upgrades of the application. 

To create the deployment it is exactly the same definition file as the replicat set, Only the kind changes to Deployment 

LAB 3 DEPLOYMENT to access the lab go to : https://uklabs.kodekloud.com/topic/deployments-5/

from 1 to 9, same questions as above

10) Create a new Deployment using the deployment-definition-1.yaml (there is an issue with the file, so try to fix ti)
 > vim deployment-definition-1.yaml 
  /there is an error on the kind, this is case sensitive 
  /after fixing, run 
 > kubectl create -f deployment-definition-1.yaml 
11) Create a new Deployment with the below attributes using your own deployment definition file with this information : 
    Name: httpd-frontend 
    Replicas: 3
    image : httpd: 2.4-alpine
  > vim  my-deploy-def-file.yaml  
  after editing the file run command 
  >kubectl create -f my-deploy-def-file.yaml

CERTIFICATION TIP : Formatting output with kubectl 

The default output format for all <kubectl> commands is human readable plain-tex format. 

The -o flag allows us to outpout the details in several different formats. 

> kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] -o <output_format>
Here is some of the commonly used formats: 

1) -o json : Output a JSON formatted API object. 
2) -o name : Print ony the resource name and nothing else.
3) -o wide : Output int the plain-text format with any additional information
4) -o yaml : Output a YAML formatted API object 

 for more details, refer :  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/ 

IV NAMESPACES 
  -----------
Namespaces helps as to logical isolate kubernetes object. Each name space have rules. 
Kubernetes creates 3 namespace automaticaly 
  Default : This is the one used by the users directly 
  Kube-system : This is where kubernets deploys the pods for it's own purpose, such as DNS service, proxy and 
  Kube-public : this is where are created resources that will be available for all users 

U can ofcause create ur own namespace to organise your workflow 
Note that the objects created in the same namespace refer to each other simply by thier names. 

An object created in one namespace can reach an object created in another. for that, u must append the name of the namespace to the object name 
in full, u will have something like this : 
<Service-name>.<namespace>.<service>.<domain>
for example to reach the db service named db-service deployed in dev namespace you will do : 
db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local

To use command in a given namespace, add the --namespace=<namespace name> to kubectl commands. 
for example to list the pods deployed in kube-system namespace do : 

kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system

If you want to specifie in witch namespace you want to create an object in it's definition file, add
  namespace : <namespace> in the metadata section of the object 

To create your namespace you can use a definition file like this 
 apiVersion : v1
 kind : Namespace
 metadata : 
   name : <namespace_name>

or simply by runnig the command 
kubectl create namespace <namespace_name>

you can define witch namespace you want to be the default by running this command 

 >kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=<new_default_namespace>

to see objects created in all namespaces run 
kubectl get <object> --all-namespace

You can limit the resource usage in a namespace by creatting a resource Quota

For that u can create a definition file like this : 

 apiVersion : v1
 kind : ResourceQuota 
 metadata: 
   name : computa-quota 
   namespace : dev
 spec : 
   hard : 
     pods : "10"
     requests.cou "4"
     requests.memory : 5Gi
     limits.cpu : "10"
     limits.memory : 10 Gi

V CERTIFICATION TIP : IMPERATIVE COMMANDSS
-------------------------------------------

While you would be wroking mostly the declarative way using definitions files, imperative  commands can help in getting on time tasks done quickly, as well as generate a definition template easily. This would help save considerable amount of time during your exams.

Before we begin, familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:

> --dry-run : By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command, u can use --dry-run:client option. This will not create the resource, instead , tell u whether the resource can be created and if you command is right. 

> -o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on screen. 

Use the above two in combination to generate a resource definition file quickly, that you can then modify and create resources as required, instead of creating the files from scratch.

Exemple : 


> kubectl run nginx --image=nginx /this will create an nginx Pod
> kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml /this will generate a Pod manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it (--dry-run)

> kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx /this will create a Deployment 
> kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml /this will generate a Deployment definition file. 

> kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --replicas=4 /generate deployment with 4 replicas
 
Another way to do this is to save the YAML definition to a file and modify

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx--dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

You can then update the YAML file with the replicas or any other field before creating the deployment.

Service : 

Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose redis on port 6379
> kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml /This will automatcically use the pod's labels as selectors)
or 
> kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml 
/this will NOT use the pods labels a selectors, instead il will assume selectors as <app=redis>. You can not pass int selectors as an option. So it does not work very well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service.

Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes: 
> kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --name nginx-service --type=NodePort --dry-run=client -o yaml
/this will automatically use the pod's lables as selelctors, but u can not specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the onte port in manually before cretaeing the service with the pod. 
or 
> kubectl create service nodeport  nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml
/this will not usee the pods labels as selectors

Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the `kubectl expose` command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the service.

to sum up : 
kubectl expose /this will use automatically the pod's labels as selectors. but you can not specifly the node port 
kubectl create service /this will use just app=<name>, you can not pass in selectors as an option. but you can specifly the node port

 *** (j'avais pas bien compris la question, ici pas besoin de service)
6) create a new namespace called dev-ns
 > kubectl create namespace dev-ns
7) Create a new deployment called redis-deploy in the dev-ns namespace with the redis image. it should have 2 replicas
 > kubectl create deployment redis-deploy --image=redis --namespace=dev-ns --replicas=2
8) create a pod called httpd using the image httpd:alpine in the default namespace. Next, create a service of type ClusterIP by the same name httpd. the target port for the srvice should be 80. (try to do this with as few steps as possible) 
 > kubectl run httpd --image=httpd:alpine
 > kubectl expose pod httpd --port=80 --name httpd --type=ClusterIP
