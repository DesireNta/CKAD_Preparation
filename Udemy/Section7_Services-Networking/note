I SERVICES 
  --------

Kubernetes services enable communication between various components within and outside of the application. 
they help us to connect application together. 
An application has different groups of pods.
So services enable loose coupling between micro services in applications. 
Let see about networking. 
Let's say there is a container serving a web applition, it is deployed in a node that has an IP adresse ip of 192.168.1.2
The computer in the same network has 192.168.1.10 needs to access the container that is in another network 10.244.0.2 (docker network) 
From the node it self (192.168.1.2) you can ping the container, but from the computer u can not. 
For that to happen, we will need to use a service. One of service use cas is to listen to a port on the node and forward request on that port to a pod. This type of service is known as a node port service becouse the service listns to a port on the node. 

Types of services : 

NodePort : Makes an internal pod accessible on a port on the node.
ClusterIP : This creates a virtual IP inside the cluster to enable to enable communication between differnet services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of back-end servers . 
LoadBalancer service : It provisions load balancer for the application in supported cloud provider. 

Definition file to create a service : 

 apiVerison : v1
 kind : Service
 metadata : 
     name :
     labels :  
 spec : 
     type : NodePort 
     ports : 
        - targePort : (port on wich the pod (container) is serving the app
          port : service port 
          nodePort : (the node pod between 30000 to 32767)
     selector : 
         (add the pod labels)

    -----------------------------------

1) how many Services exist on the system ? 
   > kubectl get service   /there is one service wich is created by kubernetes at launch. 
2) What is the targetPort configured on the kubernetes service ? 
   > kubectl describe service kubernetes 
3) how many services are configured on the kubernetes service ? 
   > kubectl describe service kubernetes 
4) how many endpoints are attached on the kubernetes service ?
   > kubectl describe service kubernetes 
5) How many Deployments exist on the system now? 
   > kubeclt get deploy 
6) What is the image used to create the pods in the deployment ? 
   > kubectl describe deploy simple-webapp-deployment
7) Create a new service to access the web application using the service-definition-1.yaml file 
    Name: webapp-service
    Type: NodePort
    targetPort: 8080
    port: 8080
    nodePort: 30080
    selector: simple-webapp
   > kubectl create -f service-definition-1.yaml
