I SERVICES 
  --------

Kubernetes services enable communication between various components within and outside of the application. 
they help us to connect application together. 
An application has different groups of pods.
So services enable loose coupling between micro services in applications. 
Let see about networking. 
Let's say there is a container serving a web applition, it is deployed in a node that has an IP adresse ip of 192.168.1.2
The computer in the same network has 192.168.1.10 needs to access the container that is in another network 10.244.0.2 (docker network) 
From the node it self (192.168.1.2) you can ping the container, but from the computer u can not. 
For that to happen, we will need to use a service. One of service use cas is to listen to a port on the node and forward request on that port to a pod. This type of service is known as a node port service becouse the service listns to a port on the node. 

Types of services : 

NodePort : Makes an internal pod accessible on a port on the node.
ClusterIP : This creates a virtual IP inside the cluster to enable to enable communication between differnet services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of back-end servers . 
LoadBalancer service : It provisions load balancer for the application in supported cloud provider. 

Definition file to create a service : 

 apiVerison : v1
 kind : Service
 metadata : 
     name :
     labels :  
 spec : 
     type : NodePort 
     ports : 
        - targePort : (port on wich the pod (container) is serving the app
          port : service port 
          nodePort : (the node pod between 30000 to 32767)
     selector : 
         (add the pod labels)

II INGRESS NETWORKING 
   ------------------

It can confuse more than one to say the diffent between ingress and service and when to use what. 
To review the corse, go to : https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/learn/lecture/13302764#overview
it has a lot of explaination that helps to enderstand. 

Ingress helps the users to access the application using a single, externally url that you can configure to route to different services within the cluster based on the url path. At the same time, implement SSL security as well.
So you can think ingress as a layer 7 load balancer builtin to the kubernetes cluster that can be configured using kubernetes primitives just like any other object in k8s. Rememeber, this is a kubernetes object, so you need to expose it to make it accessible outside the cluster. 
To create a ingress, u will need to deploy an INGRESS CONTROLLER (nginx, haproxy or traefix ...) and an INGRESS RESOURCES. 
One thing to know. A kubernets cluster does not come with an ingress controller by default. 

   Ingress controller : 

This must be deployed, there a number of solutions available for ingress controller. there are different solutions out there like GCE http(s) for google cloud platform, Istio, Contour, HAproxy, nginx and so on.

GCE and nginx are being supported and maintenained by kubernetes project. An ingress controller is deployed like any other deployement in kubernetes. 

apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment 
metadata : 
   name : nginx-ingress-controller
spec : 
  replicas : 1
  selector : 
    matchLabels : 
       name : nginx-ingress
    template : 
       metadata : 
          labels : 
             name : nginx-ingress 
       spec : 
         containers : 
            - name : nginx-ingress-controller
              image : quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.21.0
         args : 
           - /nginx-ingress-controller
           - --configmap=$(POD_NAMESPACE)/nginx-configuration
         env : 
          - name : POD_NAME 
            valueFrom 
              fieldRef : 
                fielPath : metadata.name 
          _ name : POD_NAMESPACE 
            valueFrom 
              fieldRef: 
                fielPath : metadata.namespace
          ports : 
           - name : http 
             containerPort : 80 
           - name : https 
             containerPort : 443

After creation we need a service of type of NodePort to epose it outside of the cluster.  
As mentioned before, the ingress controlles have additional intelligence built into them to monitor the kubernetes cluster for ingress resources and configure the underling nginx server when something has changed. So for the ingress controller to do that, it requires a service account with the right set of permissions. So for that we will hava to create a service account. 

  Ingress resource : 

An ingress resource is a set of rules and configurations applied on the ingress controller.
ingress resource is created using a definition file : 

apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadada : 
  name : give_it_a_name 
spec : 
  rules: 
  - http : 
      paths : 
        - path: /toto
          backend : 
             serviceName: service_name_1
             servicePort : 80
        - path: /titi
          backend : 
            serviceName : service_name_2
            servicePort : 80 

In k8s version 1.20+ we can create an Ingress resource from the imperative way like this:
- kubectl create ingress <ingress_name> --rule = "host/path=service:port"

FAQ - What is the rewrite-target option?
Different ingress controllers have different options that can be used to customise the way it works. NGINX Ingress controller has many options that can be seen here: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/ . I would like to explain one such option that we will use in our labs. The Rewrite target option https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/rewrite/

Our watch app displays the video streaming webpage at http://<watch-service>:<port>/

Our wear app displays the apparel webpage at http://<wear-service>:<port>/


We must configure Ingress to achieve the below. When user visits the URL on the left, his request should be forwarded internally to the URL on the right. Note that the /watch and /wear URL path are what we configure on the ingress controller so we can forwarded users to the appropriate application in the backend. The applications don't have this URL/Path configured on them:


http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch   -->  http://<watch-service>:<port>/
http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear    -->  http://<wear-service>:<port>/

Without the rewrite-target option, this is what would happen:

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch  --> http://<watch-service>:<port>/watch
http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear   --> http://<wear-service>:<port>/wear

Notice watch and wear at the end of the target URLs. The target applications are not configured with /watch or /wear paths. They are different applications built specifically for their purpose, so they don't expect /watch or /wear in the URLs. And as such the requests would fail and throw a 404 not found error. 

To fix that we want to "ReWrite" the URL when the request is passed on to the watch or wear applications. We don't want to pass in the same path that user typed in. So we specify the rewrite-target option. This rewrites the URL by replacing whatever is under rules->http->paths->path which happens to be /pay in this case with the value in rewrite-target. This works just like a search and replace function.

For example: replace(path, rewrite-target)
In our case: replace("/path","/")

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  namespace: critical-space
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /pay
        backend:
          serviceName: pay-service
          servicePort: 8282

In another example given here : https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/rewrite/, this could also be:
replace("/something(/|$)(.*)", "/$2")

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
  name: rewrite
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: rewrite.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: http-svc
          servicePort: 80
        path: /something(/|$)(.*)

III NETWORK POLICY
    -------------

By default, in kubernetes all pods deployed in all nodes can communicate to each other. 
You can implement some rules to prevent some pods to reach other by using network policy.
A network policy is created like any other object in kubernetes. It will apply to the pods it is lined with. 
Definition file : 

apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : NetworkPolicy
metadata : 
  name : <give_it_a_name>
spec : 
  PodSelector : 
   matchLabels : 
      key : value
  PolicyTypes : 
   - Ingress 
  Ingress : 
   - from : 
     - podSelector : 
         matchLabels : 
            key : value 
     Ports : 
     - protocol : TCP 
       port : 3306

5) Create a network policy to allow traffic from the Internal application only to the payroll-service and db-service. 
   Use the spec given on the below. You might want to enable ingress traffic to the pod to test your rules in the UI
      Policy Name: internal-policy
      Policy Type: Egress
      Egress Allow: payroll
      Payroll Port: 8080
