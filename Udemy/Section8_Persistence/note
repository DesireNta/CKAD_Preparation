I VOLUMES 
  -------

Container are ment to do one task and when that task is completed, the container is destroyed and all data inside are destroyed too. 
So to persist data processed by the containers, we attach a volume to the container when they are created. 
The data processed by the container is now planced in this volume thereby retaining it permanently. 
So, even if the container is deleted, the data generated or created will remain. 

Let's look at a simple implementation of volumes in kubernetes. 

We have a single node cluster, we create a pod that generates a rondom number and writes it at /data/number.out. In this case, if the pod is deleted so the number will be. To retain de genereted number, we create a volume. A volume needs a storage, that can be configured different ways. For now let's choose to use a directory on the host. /data for example.  Once the volume is create, we have to mount it in the container. 

II PERSISTENT VOLUMES 
   ------------------
In the last part, when we create a volume, it was created in the pod's definition file. 
Now, when u have a large environment with a lot of users deploying a lot of pods. the users would have to configure storage everytimefor each pod. instead of that, we would like to manage storage more centrally. You would like it to be configured iin a way that an admin cna create a large pool of storage. 
That is the purpose of persistent volumes.

A persistent volume is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes configurad by an administrator to be used when deploying applications on the cluster. The users can select to use which volume using persitant volume claims. 

Definition file for the persistent volume: 

apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata : 
   name : <give_it_a_name>
spec : 
  accessModes :  /to define how the volume should be mounted on the hosts. 
     - ReadWriteOnce / Can be ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany
  capacity : 
     storage : <the amount of the volume>
  hostPath : 
     path : /data    
                  
  or use one of the solution of the volume storage available. 
  
  awsElasticaBlockStore : 
    volumeID : <volume-id>
    fsType : ext4


III PERSISTENT VOLUME CLAIMS 
    ------------------------

To make the storage available to a nodeo, we need to create a persistent volume claim.   
Persistent volumes and persistent volumes claims have a one to one relationship. 
Persistent volume claim definition file 

apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim 
metadata : 
   name : <give-it-a-name>
spec : 
   accessModes : 
      - ReadWriteOnce
   resources : 
    requests : 
      storage : <amount needed>

Using PVCs in PODs

Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVC Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim

The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.

--- Lab 1 Persistent volumes, to access the lab go to : https://uklabs.kodekloud.com/topic/persistent-volumes-5/

1) Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host. Use the spec provided below. 
     Name: webapp
     Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
     Volume HostPath: /var/log/webapp
     Volume Mount: /log

   > kubectl create -f pod.yaml

2) Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification. 
     Volume Name: pv-log
     Storage: 100Mi
     Access Modes: ReadWriteMany
     Host Path: /pv/log
     Reclaim Policy: Retain
      
  > kubectl create -f persistent-volume.yaml

3) Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a Persistent Volume Claim with the given specification.
     Volume Name: claim-log-1
     Storage Request: 50Mi
     Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce
